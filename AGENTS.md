# Repository Instructions

- Read `C:\Users\danie\Desktop\Mig\Programmering\Git\folkevalget\FOLKEVALGET_DESIGN_LANGUAGE.md` at the start of each task involving design or feature work, and use it to validate that all changes uphold the project's design and product rules.
- Keep the interface focused and avoid clutter. Prefer fewer, clearer elements over adding more UI chrome, labels, badges, or decorative containers.
- Follow the existing design rules and visual language already established in the repo. Extend current patterns instead of inventing a competing style.
- Do not use pill-shaped UI treatments. Avoid pill buttons, pill tabs, pill filters, and fully rounded badge/chip patterns unless the user explicitly asks for them.
